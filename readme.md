- **Color Detection**: Detects the position of the player and the NPC based on the selected colors.
- **Automated Movement**: Moves the player towards the NPC based on the detected positions.
- **Threading**: Uses threading to improve performance by running detection and movement processes concurrently.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyAutoGUI
- NumPy
